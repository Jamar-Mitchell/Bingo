Generate virtual bingo cards and play!

# How to use

Simpy write down the names of the people bingo cards need to be generated for and the amount of cards they require in the namesList.txt file, then run the Bingo.java file.
The namesList.txt file should follow this format: FIRSTNAME LASTNAME NUMCARDS(INT).
All the bingo cards will be generated in the "cards" folder.
Enjoy!
